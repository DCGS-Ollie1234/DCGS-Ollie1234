    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>A real confidence on converting shift code through basic methods.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To expand my knowledge of code conversion </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I believe so, I was able to convert into decimal, characters, binary and hexadecimal confidently</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Through this lesson I was only given a small piece of the puzzle essentially, to complete the task I was going to have to figure how to use that information to convert into other forms of code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Through this lesson I never had a chance to question though not in the way you might immediately think. Along the lesson I was confident throughout, I was able to almost immediately have a theory or a way to develop my code and then put it into code for most of the time for work.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Tackling the task, I did this independently without the help or advice from my peers because I felt I did this lesson with real confidence in coding though I'm definitely  far from being actually good at coding though this is a start…. I think</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>As I write this, reflecting I feel this lesson was a positive, efficient development in my learning where I reflected from the previous writing of my blogs and where I reflected in previous lesson.. is this inception. I need to know, I have never watched the movie, is it good?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>As a IT ritual to summon the one true coding god, at the start of each lesson the class would of course sign in on their computer and then bring themselves to the front of the class for the ritual, weekly talk. This talk was short, a great talk where I fully understood and didn’t need to engage with questions and where I wasn’t asked a question also.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>In the possibly one of the most enjoyable subjects of the week(maybe) , I felt that I understood the task and the code to work with in a real efficient manner. Of course this Thursday was not at all 100% perfect because everyone has someway that their learning could be improved to a varying degree; of course. I recognize this though… This Thursday IT learning was pretty high up on there, I truly believe I was able to through myself from the opposite side of the class to my computer, start work with a true mindset of what I need to do. Saying this, I didn't know all the steps to get to my objective though, (I’m not that good, I’m good but not that good) however I was able to discover the answer through tests and exploration. I believe I should ask Mr Keen how I can advance possibly, what the next step is to maximize my learning.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time if I find myself in the similar situation as before, where I have almost practically completed the task and independently developed my code where I had long lengths of conversion. I believe that in this specific situation, I should have independently combined previous lessons of code to that Thursday’s lesson to where I could convert binary to hexadecimal or other conversions of code. Through this I feel I would increase my learning each lesson, then I believe I should ask how I can develop further because I have understood the tasks so much once I have given advice (not the answer) to peers who possibly don’t understand. Though a situation where I am a one of few who understand coding is something of a myth.</td>
