    <td>Good knowledge of html and css, basic knowledge on google sheets capabilities and I have a developed thimble website.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To use all the advanced, complicated and confusing resources given, including w3schools to expand my learning.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>This lesson did not involve my targets, whereas the lesson expanded other areas of my learning where I did not have any personal targets on going.</td>

    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Of the duration of this lesson, I persevered through finalising and discovering the answers to the questions I had in my head on my task. To complete this task, I had to figure out how to not only code the information in such a way that each variable would work like cogs in a machine, then also putting down the figures into an appealing looking format. I struggled on finding the prices of variables in my planning, the actual coding I had to use was very easy and was code that I have practiced and used before</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Questioning, I did this from questioning what math would be required, that also what math I was doing is right to get a certain percentage of profit. Though most of this lesson consisted of seeing the capabilities of google sheets, using already practiced code and experimenting with what I personally can do with the coding</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I did not require the assistance, the advice or tips from others. Instead I once again wanted to show what I can do, no matter what progress I make, I want to make that process on my own. This is about my personal progress in most circumstances(not in a group collaboration) to show and see what I am capable no matter how little, because that only teaches me what I need to do to improve or become better- there is always room for improvement.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I wanted to reflect on lessons from before, lessons dedicated to expanding my learning of the coding within google sheets and other such programs. I reflected on targets of previous lessons, I tried to act on these targets and improve for the better of my learning. Through reflecting, I was able to have the area of coding very easily done with little stretching of my capabilities.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>Upon writing and reflecting this blog, I realise of the time spent together as a class discussing the task of the lesson did not engage to a huge extent whatsoever. As a result, a target and idea to keep in mind for the future is that I should contribute and engage while also ensuring I understand information in the discussions to further improve my learning.</td>

    <td>After the legendary class discussions, at the weekly session involving learning about a subject of coding, codes to use and the task/s of the lesson. Upon reflecting on the lesson, I believe I spent most of my energy and focus of the lesson on finding the perfect, realistic prices to the exact penny which took a long amount of time that should have been on expanding my code learning. I realise that of course the whole point of the task is to not to have an exact party planning google sheet presentation with perfect details, however to focus on using practiced and learnt coding on an application. </td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>To improve my learning next time, I would need to change the way I approach fake scenarios on google sheets and how I can improve the speed in which I learn.  With this, I need to step back from the situation/task and use this chance to reflect on the present on what needs to be done to learn as much as possible from this situation, to understand this would improve my earning immensely. By just simply pausing from the situation, I could wrap my head around what has to be done, what is the real objective- the objective that focuses on my learning and is appropriate. In use of this change in my learning, it would then continue to improve my learning and really increase my efficiency of how I learn.</td>
