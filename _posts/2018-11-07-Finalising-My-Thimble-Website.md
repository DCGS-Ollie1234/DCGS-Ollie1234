    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I was able to submit a finished, developed and detailed website online as evidence of my work. My website has all the basic content along with fairly advanced content to hopefully have something from the average website on thimble.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I continued my adventure through exploring the jungle of code that lives in Thimble, I had some final details set in stone in my mind though I was not  finding a way to translate it into the website. Majority of the details (eg.a profile picture) I was able to very easily add, however adding a button like feature was hard to translate from my github code so that took some time during this lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>The duration of this lesson was all about developing, finalizing and adding details; I believe there was very little room to question. As a result I did not questioning this Thursday, however I feel this perfect for my learning in this situation because it meant I could develop my website from my developed learning.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Of this intense IT lesson, I really set to work with a flexible however set vision of what I would want my website to look like; so I logged in and started straight after I opened some useful tools of information. This lesson was definitely a lot about putting to what I know down onto code, I want to show what I can do so as a result I was defiantly very independent in my work</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>Definitely a setback of this lesson, I was concentrating too much on just the code of the website; if this can be a setback. To explain, through this lesson I was not reflecting on previous lessons along with my blogs, this meant a bugging target that has been the same for a while was not completed. I should have been looking at w3schools for example a lot more, though in fairness I was looking a lot at the google slides of information given.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>Since our leader Mr Keen was not in this lesson, with a PE substitute ; I was not able to engage in any class discussions. Also this lesson was about showing my level of skill on code in independence and working on my website to a point where I could submit it in confidence that it is finished for now.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>My thinking is that this lesson was not for learning, if you could give me a chance to explain; from the start it was about doing more in a higher ratio to learning compared to previous lessons. However through coding a lot, making big finalizing changes to my website did have learning, yes. Though I still stick to my thinking that there was not a lot of learning code specifically, just learning more of the capabilities of thimble and what I can mold it to what I have in mind. Finally, in my learning my exploration of new codes within Thimble could have gotten better in this lesson to develop my understanding of coding.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Improving my learning for next time, I would need to really dive into the absolute ocean of code that is w3schools. W3schools has lots of code to learn along with insights that expand my learning; all this I know for sure. Though despite this I rarely look into w3schools, so now that my website is at a good state in my opinion; I can now look into developing further through the website and include more advanced techniques into my lines of code. In conclusion, to improve, to develop and expand my learning further I should use some more advanced sources of info.</td>
