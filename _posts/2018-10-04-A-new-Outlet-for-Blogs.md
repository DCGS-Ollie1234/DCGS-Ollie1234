    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>During this week's lesson, we were given a new website, a new outlet on which we could publish our blogs and which could be  constantly developed on learnt through to expand our knowledge. Thimble was a html and css coding website, something that was not really used in Github and is yes something new however is fairly easy to understand or get the hang of it. I preserved through the challenges that this new format face, though it shows instantly the changes it requires writing new lines of code, as variables in Github does not exist in Thimble.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Well,I simply did not question this or on how to approach the new website, this is because a long list of step by step instructions were laid out in a really helpful collection of Google Slides. Through this I was able to understand not only how to approach the new region of untouched coding, however to also publish my website or understand what the different files such as "html" do towards the program including other features.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Independence</td>
    <td>As with something new, I felt that I wanted to approach this new website solely independently to expand my knowledge as much as possible, to ensure that I fully understand what each individual line of code so that in future I can repeat this process/ website.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>Through this, I reflected on the code that was engraved into my brain from all the time spent working away at my IPad or computer to constantly develop my Github blogs. Though not all of this coding was able to be studied in this new format, it still gave me knowledge on for example defining or expand certain variables and the relevant formatting.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>In the area of Engagement, I feel that I definitely did not engage verbally however I engaged through listening, watching on the practical given at the front such as every lesson almost. I engaged through reading carefully and confidently the instructions online, I engaged through writing theories of code into the new website.</td>

    <td>This particular Thursday, I felt that my learning could have not too much in the way of better. With getting a quick, efficient start on this new website Thimble ; developing, learning about css, html and the new formatting. As a light in the darkness of the same old Github, Thimble was introduced which was instantly so much easier; it was instant in the term of changing relevant with the new code, easy and quick with no error signs after waiting so long. This new website also brought new areas to be learnt, to be understood and master such as Github; however Thimble wa something that I could constantly develop each week instead of doing it once, then forever leaving it. So through Thimble, through this new region of unexplored code, was an outlet not just for my blogs but also for a better way of learning, in and out of lessons also.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Changes which could be made includes to look towards other given tools to improve not only my learning however also my new outlet for blogs, Thimble. A given tool, or suggested tool included the website w3shcools, a learning code website which gives information not only on the formats within Github however also on Thimble. I believe if I had looked towards w3shcools within the lesson then I would have been able to really improve my learning. In conclusion, I should use other tools, or given pieces of informations to really improve my learning.</td>
