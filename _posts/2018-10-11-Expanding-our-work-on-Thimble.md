    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To develop my thimble website and my understanding of the code within.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I was able to really get my website to a point in which I was fairly happy with, something not complete however looks good and works which is great. Through this lesson, I learnt about not only html code, thimble formatting however also I learnt more of the code I used in my github website.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>As learning should, the coding of course stretched me, it forced me to really look and learn what each individual line of code meant ; something github never forced me to do. Resulting in me persevering through finding a way in which my website would only look good but work; at the start I was having issues with my links such as the link to go back to the home page or go to  different blog and I was struggling through that.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Well to learn, it involves questioned an since I accomplished a lot of learning I would say I definitely questioned; though I feel however I did not question anything specific. Though my questioning in many things through this lesson meant I could really learn, to develop my website in confidence.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I wanted to take this new website, this new opportunity to not only develop my coding skills but to also do more with the website and to have complete control. I took this 2nd chance almost as something that I could use independently to learn quite a bit more than github, through out this lesson was diligently independent as I find the answers to my issues.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>Throughout this lesson, most importantly at the start I reflected through writing my previous blogs and remembered last week's target; my target was to use given resources to expand my learning as previously I never used them. Through not only reflecting however through my revorces I was able to learn details and why to the coding I wa sinputting and have so many times before along with the new coding I was adding to the growing list of variables. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>Unfortunately, the class was not given one of Mr Keenâ€™s great "come to the front" learning sessions, we were forced to learn really independently; also the coding was frankly easy , especially with all the resources so no wonder we were set to learn more independently. Though I enjoyed this, I was creating a website that I was able to explain to anyone testing me on each individual element of my coding whilst creating something that worked and looked pretty good for a work in progress.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>On reflection, I feel that through this lesson I gotten too carried away with the finer details of the website, to not look at a lot of the given resources and to only glance at them few enough times than I was not able to learn alot from the resources. However,  I confidently checked and combed through the information on the given google slides presentation to were at home or at the next lesson I can look into learning details of information from w3schools to expand my knowledge. Also, I feel upon looking back at the lesson that I was too afraid of adding anything that I did not completely understand which in one sense is great as it forces me to learn before throwing something unknown in. On the other hand I was not adding something unknown meant I missed an opportunity to possibly fast learn about the coding or open my mind and blog to new coding.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>To improve my learning for next time, I would need to almost base my progress of the information given through w3schools, through this I feel my learning would be greatly improved. Using this dictionary of information, I would be able to take my website to a whole lot more detail, with better design and to help to fix and answer possibly the questions or problems I am faced with. My learning was something definitely to be improved on without the use of w3schools</td>
