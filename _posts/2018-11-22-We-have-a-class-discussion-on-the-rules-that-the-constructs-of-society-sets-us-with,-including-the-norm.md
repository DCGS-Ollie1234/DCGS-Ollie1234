    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>This lesson, we had a very small online test which I believe was more for Mr keen collecting data then getting our grades or anything else. This test which we completed within the first 10 or so minutes, it was actually quite new for me with some information that I have not really seen or had to use before. Being someone who has to explains a lot of things to my family at home, I am constantly learning almost about all sorts of programmes and taught myself what capabilities there are in such programs; from this I was able to work out a good amount in the test fairly easily while using previous knowledge.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Our small test in this lesson, it contained some new or not so obvious subjects that took an extra 2 seconds to figure out and get the marks, for data than anything else. So I questioned on where I have seen this area of computer science before or how could I work out this? I found this got me a higher score in the end, with a not too bad score of 7/10</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>As this was a test, as small as it was, I wanted to show my knowledge and understanding of computer science to whatever degree and no matter how low a mark it could be. Of course I did not cheat or tell others the answers , I wanted this test to be as useful as possibly for the data, otherwise the data will be false lying information that would not benefit anyone- if anything it would simply negative effect on mr keen's knowledge on what as a class or year understand</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>Though the questions in the tests, to having a class discussion on how the media and the ones around us sets the norm; I was constantly reflecting on everything for the class discussion and reflecting on previous computer science lessons for the questions in the small test. Reflecting definitely expanded my learning for the better, my mind was really opened by the arguments Mr keen made and my mind was blown.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>In majority, the lesson was made up of having a class discussion about how social media and general society constructs set the norm for us, how everything connected to that also has a lot about us in how conform really. I found this discussion really interesting, so I engaged with my eyes and ears, to try to learn and expand my understanding. Other than this I did not engage, which was a negative on my learning.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>In my learning, as much as my mind was expanded I realise on reflection that to improve my learning and possibly in this situation others around, my engagement could have gone better last lesson. As much as it was a listening and learn, I believe I could have asked question and or give my extra insights from my point of view to not only improve the learning of me but also possibly others around. On reflection, engagement is becoming a fairly common target or area to improve in these science lessons - I want to stop this and make amends to my learning because my learning in this area of engagement is not improving enough.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>In order to really improve my learning, I must reach my target that has been around for a while- too long- to improve my engagement in lesson. This would really boost my learning, along with learning the skills that are brought with being confident to engage a lot more than previous in lessons. To make a change to my engagement, as in using this skill of engaging in lessons would make some serious changes to my learning and not just for my learning in lessons </td>
