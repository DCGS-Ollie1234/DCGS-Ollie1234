    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Good knowledge of html and css, basic knowledge on google sheets capabilities and I have a developed thimble website.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To have, at least , a basic knowledge of conventions with binary, hexadecimal and decimal.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I believe I was able to further understand the conversions from my basic knowledge which I obtained during year 7, so as a result I did complete this target.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Honestly, I struggled at first on converting to binary along with hexadecimal. Despite already done enough math already, I wanted to really persevere and give it all so I could achieve a high grade. I also knew that if I mastered this painful subject know, it meant I could be assured in the future where I would be required to convert using these formats. I put all my attention towards the front of the class to learn about these conversions, I wanted to try at least.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Throughout this learning process, I was constantly questioning in all sorts of ways in attempt to really master this skill. One of the first questions I asked was , "Is there an easier way?" so that thought tumbled and grew into looking for patterns in the conversions that would make my life much easier. At first I did not see any patterns, though this process made me look at all the details and reasons- as a result I understood to a higher degree.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>On reflecting now, I realise I was not understanding the method to convert quickly which is something a lot of others around me understood, this meant I was at a great disadvantage. I realize now that throughout that lesson I should have  asked for help or some insight into this method so I would achieve a higher amount of correct answers in the first small experimenting test.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>In true honesty, I am not great at most areas maths which does not help this are of computing science. As a result the binary conversions needed some work,  there was apparently an easy pattern that was supposed to be obvious but I couldn't relate this into practice easily so I did give up on that to do it the hard way.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>Thinking about that lesson now, it comes to me that I should engage with the class to learn and see what I was not understanding in detail so that Iâ€™m not understanding the full conversion picture in a sense. I believe this held me back, not engaging with the class as much and not asking questions- I did not want to get it wrong which is why I did not engage as much I should have.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Throughout this not so fun computing science lesson, I was doing the same the thing throughout which meant my learning was not as great as it should be; I was not engaging, answering questions, asking them or talking to others about this subject to expand my understanding. This was a major factor that could have gone better in my learning, to counteract this from the lesson I have revised further the subject of conversions, going out and finding tips or quick conversions so that in the test and in the future I would be able to achieve a high grade in any tests or end of year grades.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>To improve my learning for next time, more specifically in this subject of conversions, I would need to engage in class discussions so that I would be able to show my understanding to where I could learn what I'm not getting to then master this subject. Also, I need to ask questions that I have, so I could have them answered to expand my learning and understanding; this change would propel me forward more and was holding me back in the previous lesson.</td>
